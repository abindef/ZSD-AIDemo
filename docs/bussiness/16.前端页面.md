# Role
You are a Senior Frontend Developer expert in Vue 3 and Enterprise UI design.

# Task
Based on the attached screenshot, please reconstruct this "Batch Payment Management" page.
The page is complex, so we will break it down into a layout structure and specific components.

# Visual Analysis (Layout Breakdown)
The page consists of three main vertical sections:
1.  **Header Filter Area**: Contains multiple input fields (Payment No, Date Range, Status) and action buttons (Search, Reset).
2.  **Middle Split Pane**:
    * **Left Pane (60% width)**: A data table for "Batch Payment Orders" (columns: Checkbox, Order No, Dept, Company, Date, Amount, Status). Note the Tabs on top (Pending, Approved, All).
    * **Right Pane (40% width, Highlighted in Red)**: A "Supplier Info" section. It seems to be a related detail view triggered by selecting a row on the left.
3.  **Bottom Section**: A "Payment Details" table showing line items for the selected order.

# Technical Requirements
1.  **Library**: Use **Element Plus** components (`el-container`, `el-row`, `el-col`, `el-table`, `el-form`).
2.  **Responsiveness**: Use `el-row` and `el-col` to mimic the grid layout.
3.  **Types**: Define TypeScript interfaces first.
    * `interface PaymentOrder { ... }` (for the left table)
    * `interface SupplierInfo { ... }` (for the right panel)
    * `interface PaymentDetail { ... }` (for the bottom table)
4.  **Mock Data**: Generate realistic mock data to populate the tables so the layout can be visualized.

# Deliverable Step 1
Please first generate the **TypeScript Interfaces** and the **Basic Layout Shell** (using placeholder comments for the 3 main sections). Do not write the full complex tables yet.
